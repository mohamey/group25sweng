# Aware Location Context Provider
This was a college group project where a plugin was required for the [Aware Framework](https://awareframework.com) for Android Devices. The plugin takes the users location every 5 minutes, and provided they're in a different place it asks the user to give context to the location in the evening in the form of a survey. The plugin also passively records the users application usage in these locations. This plugin was developed for a PhD student to help her conduct her research.

The plugin is written in Java and XML, and uses a remote PHP server and MySQL database to store data. The built plugin available on the releases page should be installed on an Android device, then loaded through the Aware Framework application.
